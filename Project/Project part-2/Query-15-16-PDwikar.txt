Access Permissions:
I will control the access permissions using Roles.
I will create roles for different departments e.g. : Legal, Campaign Management etc.
Then I will assign each user to respective roles.
Also I can control access permission on individual person
Following are the examples of how I will implement the access rights for each individual person

Any staffer can access voter, candidate, and proposition info. 
For all the staffers I will add the permissions to access these tables using the following Grant statements:
	User: Frazzled
	GRANT SELECT ON VOTER  TO Frazzled
	GRANT SELECT ON CANDIDATE  TO Frazzled
	GRANT SELECT ON PROPOSITION  TO Frazzled
	
	Role: Staffer (Includes all users)
	GRANT SELECT ON VOTER  TO Staffer
	GRANT SELECT ON CANDIDATE  TO Staffer
	GRANT SELECT ON PROPOSITION  TO Staffer
	
Any staffer can enter survey info
For all the staffers I will add the permissions to insert in the Voter_Proposition table:
	User: Frazzled
	GRANT INSERT ON VOTER_PROPOSITION TO Frazzled
	 
Any staffer can see event info, but not who is there. 
For all the staffers I will add the permissions to see Staff_Itinerary table columns except Staffer_Name and Contact_Phone columns:
	User: Frazzled
	GRANT SELECT (LOCATION, EVENT_DATE, EVENT_TIME, EVENT) ON STAFF_ITINERARY TO Frazzled
	
Legal can access and change donor records. 
For a Legal department user, I will add permissions to select and update the donor records:
	User: Slithering
	GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON DONOR TO Slithering
	
Campaign management can see donor info. 
For all the campaign managers I will add the permissions to see the donor information
	User: Devious
	GRANT SELECT ON DONOR TO Devious
	
Campaign management can see and update staff itinerary, and candidate info. 
For all campaign managers I will add the permissions to see and update the staff itinerary and candidate info:
	User: Devious
	GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON STAFF_ITINERARY TO Devious
	GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON CANDIDATE TO Devious
	
Campaign management can add categories 
For all campaign managers I will add the permissions to insert new categories:
	User: Devious
	GRANT INSERT ON CATEGORY TO Devious
	
Only campaign management can see and update vendor payments. 
For all campaign managers I will add the permissions to see and update vendor payments:
	User: Devious
	GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON VENDOR_PAYMENT TO Devious

The constraints shown in the ERD are implemented using the Primary Key constraints, Composite key constraints, Foreign key constraints and Sequences.
Indexes are created as required. In Oracle when an index is created it is a BTree index by default.

Challenges faced using SQLPlus:
a. We cannot have a column name as 'Date'. 
Hence I used a column name as Event_Date in Staff_Itinerary table and Payment_Date in Vendor_Payment table.

b. SQLPlus does not allow AutoIncrement for unique keys.
Hence I used Oracle Sequences for the primary key in VOTER table.
